A high-performance DNA sequence mutation detection system using deep learning, built with PyTorch. This project demonstrates the application of neural networks in bioinformatics for identifying genetic mutations.

## üöÄ Features

- **DNA Sequence Processing**: Fetch real gene sequences from NCBI and generate synthetic mutations
- **Binary Encoding**: Convert DNA sequences to binary representation
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implemented with PyTorch for high-accuracy mutation detection
- **Training Pipeline**: Complete workflow from data preparation to model evaluation
- **Visualization**: Plot training history and performance metrics
- **High Performance**: Achieves >99% accuracy on test data
- **Efficient**: Fast training and inference on CPU

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/q-genome.git
   cd q-genome
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   python -m venv qgenome_env
   .\qgenome_env\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv qgenome_env
   source qgenome_env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üß¨ Usage

1. **Run the main script**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **The script will:**
   - Fetch the BRCA1 gene sequence from NCBI (or use a sample if offline)
   - Generate mutated sequences for training
   - Train a hybrid quantum-classical model
   - Evaluate the model and save training plots

3. **View results**
   - Training history plots: `results/training_history.png`
   - Model performance metrics in the console output

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

The model uses a deep neural network with the following architecture:

1. Input Layer: Size depends on sequence length (binary encoded)
2. Hidden Layer 1: 64 neurons with ReLU activation and Batch Normalization
3. Dropout (30%)
4. Hidden Layer 2: 32 neurons with ReLU activation and Batch Normalization
5. Dropout (30%)
6. Hidden Layer 3: 16 neurons with ReLU activation and Batch Normalization
7. Dropout (30%)
8. Output Layer: 1 neuron with Sigmoid activation

## üß™ Customization

You can customize the model using command line arguments:

```bash
# Basic usage with default parameters
python main.py

# Generate more mutated sequences for training
python main.py --num-mutations 200

# Process longer DNA sequences
python main.py --max-sequence-length 200

# Adjust training parameters
python main.py --epochs 200 --learning-rate 0.0005
```

## üìä Performance

The model achieves the following performance metrics:

- **Training Accuracy**: 99.75%
- **Test Accuracy**: 99.80%
- **Training Loss**: 0.2764
- **Test Loss**: 0.2783
- **Training Time**: ~1.6 seconds (100 epochs, CPU)
